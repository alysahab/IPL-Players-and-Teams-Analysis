# IPL 2024 Insights: Sports Basics Magazine Edition (Codebasics Resume Challenge)

Welcome to the IPL 2024 Insights project for the Sports Basics, a special edition magazine aimed at providing intriguing insights and facts for cricket fans, analysts, and teams based on the past three years' data. In this project, I leveraged Python for analysis, Power BI for visualization, and a PowerPoint presentation to communicate findings effectively.

## Project Overview
This comprehensive project integrates data analysis conducted in a Python notebook with visualization in Power BI and a detailed presentation in PowerPoint. The analysis encompasses primary insights such as top batsmen, bowlers, and team performances, as well as secondary insights including predictions for the current and on going IPL 2024 season.

## Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Analysis in Python:** Utilizing Python notebooks, the project conducts cleaning and transforming of datasets, and in-depth analysis to derive primary and secondary insights from IPL data spanning the past three years. Additional data is extracted to predict team winner and runner-up for the upcoming season.

2. **Consolidation into CSV Dataset:** All insights are consolidated into a single CSV dataset, facilitating seamless integration into Power BI for visualization.

3. **Power BI Dashboard Creation:** Leveraging Power BI, a dynamic dashboard is crafted to visualize primary and secondary insights, providing stakeholders with an interactive and comprehensive overview of IPL performance metrics.
